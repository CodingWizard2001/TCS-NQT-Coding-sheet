# Check For Leap Year


### Description
The provided code checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
 - **Input:** Prompt the user to enter a year.
 - **Read Input:** Read the input year from the user.
 - **Check Leap Year:** Use an if statement to check if the year is divisible by 4. Additionally, ensure that the year is either not divisible by 100 or divisible by both 100 and 400 to be considered a leap year.
 - **Output:** Print whether the given year is a leap year or not.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the execution time does not depend on the input size.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is also O(1) as it requires only a constant amount of memory to store the input year and a few variables needed for comparison and output.
