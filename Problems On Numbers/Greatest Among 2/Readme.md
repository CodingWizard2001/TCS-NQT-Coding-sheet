# Comparison of Two Numbers

### Description
The provided code compares two numbers and determines which one is greater.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
 - **Input:** Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
 - **Read Inputs:** Read the input values for the two numbers from the user.
 - **Comparison:** Use an `if-else` statement to compare the two numbers. If the first number is less than the second number, print that the second number is greater. Otherwise, print that the first number is greater.
 - **Output:** Print the result of the comparison indicating which number is greater.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the execution time does not depend on the input size.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is also O(1) as it requires only a constant amount of memory to store the input numbers and a few variables needed for comparison and output.
