# Power Calculation

### Description
The provided code calculates the power of a given number.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
 - **Input:** Prompt the user to enter a number and its power.
 - **Read Input:** Read the input number and power from the user.
 - **Check for Special Cases:** If the power is 0, set the result to 1. If the power is 1, set the result to the input number.
 - **Calculate Power:** Use a while loop to iteratively multiply the input number by itself for the given number of times (equal to the power).
 - **Output:** Print the calculated result.


### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(power)`, where power is the exponent.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is `O(1)` as it requires only a constant amount of extra memory
