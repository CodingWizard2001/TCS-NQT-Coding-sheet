# Program to Add two fractions

### Description
Adding two fractional numbers

### Steps to Solve the Problem

- The AddTwo function takes four parameters: num1, den1, num2, and den2, representing the numerators and denominators of two fractions.
- Inside the AddTwo function, it converts the numerators and denominators to floating-point numbers (float) to perform the addition accurately.
- It calculates the decimal representations of the two fractions by dividing the numerators by their respective denominators.
- It returns the sum of the two fractions.
- In the main function, it prompts the user to enter the numerators and denominators of two fractions.
- It reads the input values from the user.
- It calls the AddTwo function with the input numerators and denominators.
- It prints the result of the addition of the two fractions.
