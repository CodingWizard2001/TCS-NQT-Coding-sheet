# Rearrange array in increasing-decreasing order

### Description:
This C++ program takes the size of an array from the user, then takes input for the elements of the array. After that, it sorts the array in non-decreasing order. Finally, it prints the first half of the array in increasing order and the second half of the array in decreasing order.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
- **Input Size:** Take the size of the array from the user.
- **Input Elements:** Prompt the user to input the elements of the array one by one.
- **Sort the Array:** Use the sort function to sort the array in non-decreasing order.
- **Rearrange and Output:** Iterate through the first half of the sorted array and print its elements in increasing order. Then, iterate through the second half of the sorted array in reverse order and print its elements in decreasing order.

### Time Complexity:
The overall time complexity is O(nlogn).

### Space Complexity:
The overall space complexity is O(n).
