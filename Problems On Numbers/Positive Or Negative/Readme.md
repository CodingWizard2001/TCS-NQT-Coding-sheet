# Check For Positive or Negative Number

### Description
The provided code determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero. A positive number is greater than zero, a negative number is less than zero, and zero is neither positive nor negative.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
 - **Input:** Prompt the user to enter a number.
 - **Read Input:** Read the input number from the user.
 - **Check Positive or Negative:** Use conditional statements (if and else if) to check the value of the input number. If the number is greater than zero, it is positive. If it is less than zero, it is negative. If it is equal to zero, it is neither positive nor negative.
 - **Output:** Print the result indicating whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the execution time does not depend on the input size.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is also O(1) as it requires only a constant amount of memory to store the input number and a few variables needed for comparison and output.
