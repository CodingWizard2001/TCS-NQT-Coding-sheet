# Factorial of a Number

### Description
The provided code calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer N, denoted as N!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to N.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
 - **Input:** Prompt the user to enter a number.
 - **Read Input:** Read the input number from the user.
 - **Calculate Factorial:** Implement a function Factorial(int num) to calculate the factorial of the given number. Initialize a variable fact to 1. Use a for loop to iterate from 2 to the input number inclusive. In each iteration, multiply fact by the current value of the loop variable.
 - **Output:** Print the calculated factorial of the input number.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the input number.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as it requires only a constant amount of extra memory regardless of the value of the input number.
