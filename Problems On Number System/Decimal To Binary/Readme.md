# Decimal to Octal Conversion


### Description
The provided code converts a decimal number to its equivalent binary representation.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
- **Input:** Prompt the user to enter a decimal number.
- **Read Input:** Read the input decimal number from the user.
- **Convert to Binary:** Convert the decimal number to binary representation. This is done by repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 2 and collecting the remainders. The remainders represent the binary digits in reverse order.
- **Output:** Print the binary representation of the input decimal number.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(log N), where N is the input decimal number.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as it requires only a constant amount of extra memory.
