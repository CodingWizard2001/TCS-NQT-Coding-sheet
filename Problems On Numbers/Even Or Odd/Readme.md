# Even or Odd Number Checker

##3 Description
The provided code determines whether a given integer is even or odd. An even number is divisible by 2 without a remainder, while an odd number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
 - **Input:** Prompt the user to enter a number.
 - **Read Input:** Read the input number from the user.
 - **Check Even or Odd:** Use the `modulo operator (%)` to check if the input number is divisible by 2. If the remainder is 0, then the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.
 - **Output:** Print the result indicating whether the number is even or odd.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the execution time does not depend on the input size.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as well. It requires only a constant amount of memory to store the input number and a few variables needed for comparison and output.
