# Calculate sum of the elements of the array

### Description:
This C++ program takes the size of an array as input from the user, then takes input for the elements of the array. After that, it calculates the sum of all the elements in the array using a function named SumArray. Finally, it prints the sum of the elements.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
- **Input Size:** Take the size of the array from the user.
- **Input Elements:** Prompt the user to input the elements of the array one by one.
- **Calculate Sum:** Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of its elements.
- **Output Sum:** Print the sum of the elements of the array.

### Time Complexity:
The overall time complexity is O(n).

### Space Complexity:
The overall space complexity is O(1).
