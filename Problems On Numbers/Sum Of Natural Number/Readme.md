# Sum of First N Natural Numbers

### Description
The provided code calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers, where N is a positive integer. Natural numbers are whole numbers greater than zero.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
 - **Input:** Prompt the user to enter a number N.
 - **Read Input:** Read the input number N from the user.
 - **Calculate Sum:** Initialize a variable sum to 0. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to N (exclusive). In each iteration, add the current number to the sum.
 - **Output:** Print the calculated sum of the first N natural numbers.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the input number. Since the loop iterates from 1 to N, the time taken is linearly proportional to N.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as it requires only a constant amount of extra memory regardless of the size of N.
